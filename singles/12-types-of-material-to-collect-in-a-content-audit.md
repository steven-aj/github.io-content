Clients generally know exactly what they want, but not always how to get there or if they're even ready to try. For new projects, a content audit is essential for aligning expectations, building a sitemap and (*by extension*) defining a proper scope. Failing to conduct this is probably the most common mistake that new freelancers make.

## Collectible Material

This isn't just a list of items to collect. It's a strategic roadmap toward building any project. A thorough content audit will serve as your cornerstone for success, helping to prevent the most common pitfalls that new freelancers encounter.

The provided PDF is a great starting point for a structured approach to collecting these materials. Organize them into folders by context to make it easier to break them into manageable pieces. Further organize those pieces into a sitemap proposal along the way. Systematic organization early on not only facilitates the breakdown into manageable parts, but can also demonstrate expertise and foresight.

As promised, you can [download the checklist of material here](/downloads/documents/content-audit-checklist.pdf). I encourage you to continue reading, though, to get a clear understanding of each piece worth collecting.

> Never be afraid to be upfront about the things you need.  In the long run, you'll be grateful that you did and your client will appreciate your expertise.

### Brand Guidelines and Style Guides
Gathering brand & style guidelines early on will help you to ensure consistency in the website's design and content. You can glean a lot from logos and other materials listed here but, if they can provide it, be sure to get their specs for color schemes, typography and tone of voice.

### Previous Websites
Reviewing the content and structure of previous websites can help identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in the proposed sitemap. Request any existing live URLs or accessible codebases.

### Blog Content
Blogs can provide valuable industry insights and thought leadership while helping to identify topics of interest to their target audience. Be sure to migrate any previously published articles and their associated media.

### Social Media Profiles
Existing profiles can help provide content strategy, tone of voice and brand consistency. Ask if they have profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn or any other social media you should know about. 

> As a bonus, social profiles that already have some authority can help increase organic clicks to your client's project.

### Marketing Videos and Multimedia Content
Videos and other multimedia can be embedded to engage visitors and provide a richer user experience. Ask for marketing videos, product demonstrations, webinars and any other multimedia content they can provide.

> Heavy items like videos and podcasts can have a negative impact on a project's performance. Use a CDN or other cloud service to do the heavy lifting.

### Case Studies and Success Stories
Case studies & success stories can be repurposed to build credibility and demonstrate the client's expertise. Don't be afraid to request access to their achievements, customer testimonials or any examples of positive impacts their products or services have made on their customers.

### Marketing Collateral
Marketing collateral can provide valuable insights into the client's branding, messaging and target audience. This includes material like brochures, flyers, pamphlets, catalogs, product sheets or newsletters they've used (*or plan to use*) for marketing purposes.

### Press Releases and Media Coverage
Press releases & media coverage can help identify significant milestones, awards, partnerships or notable achievements that can be showcased. Look out for any news articles that feature the client or their products and ask if they're already aware of others.

### Market Research and Surveys
Market research and surveys can provide valuable data and insights that can be used to tailor the website content to the target audience's needs and preferences. Ask for customer surveys, industry reports or any other market research they've acquired.

### Sales Presentations and Pitch Decks
Sales presentations and pitch decks often contain valuable insights into the client's value proposition, key messaging, and unique selling points, which can inform the content strategy for the website. Collect these and glean all that you can.

### Competitor Analysis
A competitor analysis can provide insights into industry trends, best practices and areas where the client can differentiate themselves on their website. Any competitor analysis or benchmarking studies performed will do.

### Internal Documentation
While not directly marketing materials, these resources can help us gain a deeper understanding of the client's offerings and target audience. If they're willing to hand them over, get any internal documentation or resources developed like product specifications, user manuals or internal presentations.
