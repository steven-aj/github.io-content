## You Might Appreciate That...

### *I'm "Full-Stack" Ready*
I'll admit - I don't really like calling myself this (*it's such a broad term*), but I fit the bill if you're looking for a well-rounded JavaScript developer. I've worked on everything from static sites, to Vue, React, Angular & (most recently) Svelte *front-ends*, to Express backends on Node.js, to structuring app databases, and more.

### *I'm A "Passion Developer"*
I like money just as much as anyone else, but I chose this career because I genuinely love it. That is, I've been dabbling in web languages since my family bought our first computer. I was nine and... we don't have to talk about how old I am now. My idea of a good time is exploring new technologies, long walks through documentation, and a stiff drink after hunting down the elusive typo on line 277.

### *I'm Not Afraid to Break Stuff*
I have a natural curiosity for the way stuff works, which means many years of taking things apart (*sorry, pops*). I like to expedite ramp-up time on projects by creating a local branch and dissecting it to see how it was put together. 

## Things to Consider

### *I'm Not the Office-Type*
I thrive on communication and teamwork, but I prefer remote collaboration. That said, I'm never opposed to meeting local clients for a coffee to discuss a project.

### *I'm Not a Designer*
I've taken courses on design theory & know enough to (*barely*) scrape by in this department, but I've had the privilege of working with *real* designers who are just as passionate about their work as I am of mine. I prefer to let those folks do their job.

### *No Formal Education*
If you're looking exclusively for someone with a degree, it ain't me (*and won't be*). My education consists of deep-dives into docs, exploring complex topics, and occasional Udemy courses - basically, continuing education for anyone *with* a degree.
