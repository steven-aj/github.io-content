## Build a Sitemap

If you haven't already, be sure to read [12 Types of Material to Collect in a Content Audit](/blog/12-types-of-material-to-collect-in-a-content-audit). It will give you a great foundation to building a site map for any new project.

Once you've organized your content fragments, collaborate with the client on which pieces they want featured. By this point, you should have enough information to determine whether their project is better suited as a one-off landing page or a multi-page site. Since everything is already organized, you can begin creating a sitemap to give yourself (*and the client*) a rough idea of the scope of work.

You can use any mind-mapping or graphing app to generate a sitemap, though there are some affordable (*and some free*) tools built specifically for the job.
