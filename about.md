## History

We bought our first computer in 2000 and I've wanted to be a developer since. In my early twenties, I bounced between food service and electrical work until finally deciding to pursue development in 2016. I built a WordPress storefront selling Print-on-Demand stuff, but (like most startups) that fell through. My wife and I ended up traveling the West Coast where I bartered freelancing services as a nomad.

We moved back home a year later and I enrolled in an in-person bootcamp to help fill the gaps in what I had been studying of headless stacks. I learned a ton there, earned a certificate in Software Development and returned to freelancing.

Despite my initial success, I'm pretty terrible at marketing myself. When COVID hit, competition got fierce, so I returned to electrical work and came back after the pandemic subsided. I'm grateful to be back doing what I love.

## Career

I've had opportunities to work with universities, law firms, doctor's offices, agencies and bloggers. I've built a some projects from the ground up, debugged more things than I can count and helped solve problems to keep things moving.

You can find an overview of my work history in the [Experience](/experience) section.

## Goals

My short-term goal is to settle into a software development position on a modern JavaScript stack. That's partially why I built this site as a web app (*and because it's my preferred technology*). My ideal stack would be SvelteKit or Vue on a Node.js backend & NoSQL database, but I have experience in NativeScript & React plus PHP backends, too.

My long-term goal is to build a small SaaS to help freelancers operate more like the business that they are. I started working on it Summer of this year and I'm super excited to launch next year.

## Let's Connect

I'm mostly an open book, so feel free to reach out with any questions you might have (*keep it professional, of course*). I'm always eager to better myself & help people with their projects, so don't hesitate to connect if you think [I might be a good fit for your project](/blog/are-we-a-good-fit).
